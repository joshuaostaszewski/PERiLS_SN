# PERiLS_SN
StickNet code used in Ostaszewski et al. 2025 and in conjunction with code used in McDonald and Weiss 2021 (https://github.com/jessmcd/VSEAnalysisCode).

## Code to run before calculating cold pool properties
1. Storm_Angle: Calculates reflectivity angles and reflectivity gradient angles near a StickNet (SN) about an approximate cold pool TOA.
2. Storm_Motion_Algorithm: Calculates QLCS storm motion about the approximate cold pool TOA.

## Cold pool analysis code
ColdPoolProperties

The last three jupyter notebooks (TimeToSpace_plots, Detailed_MV_Analysis, PerilsPlots, PerilsPlots_2) have a bunch of plots used in both papers listed above.
